# Ultima Loader

![alt text](https://github.com/csrss/DLL_Loader/blob/master/DLL_Loader/Img/Ultima.PNG)

Another early project. This one is more powerfull version then DLoad. Written in pure C/C++. It is so old, 
that I cannot even recall what functionality it has. Basically, it loads not only drivers, but it can load DLLs, 
it can inject loading routine into different process and stuff. Pretty hakish tool, made to be something powerfull, 
made to show my coding potential, that I had in 2009.
